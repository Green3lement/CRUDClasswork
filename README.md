# CRUDClasswork

I could not find out what I did wrong here to make the app missing currentUser._id.
Because of this I rewrote the lab using Unit 3 example1 to try an find what I was missing.
Turns out that wasn't helpful in figuring out why this repo doesnt work. 

So the new repo that works and is currently running on Heroku is in the repo 'Green3lement/DeployClasswork'
This one works without the error and deploys and connects to a cloud mongoDB.
